# Yeast

Resurrecting an old thread to share a forum post from elsewhere with some useful English ale yeast
info and recommendations ...



## Dry yeasts are "OK" but I think for best results you need to get a good liquid strain on this as it will be superior.

+1 to that - the dry strains are OK, but they generally lack the character of the best British cask strains.
And it may seem obvious, but scrounging the real thing from the dregs of casks at your local pub can be a
great way to go - I think my favourite so far is Jaipur dregs - which supposedly came to Thornbridge from
Holt's via Kelham Island and went from there to Buxton, Brewdog (at least for Punk and Jackhammer) and
others, so it has some form. But most of the ones I've tried from trad breweries have been pretty good in
their different ways - and you know that proper cask strains will drop like a rock!

Also harvest from bottles, Proper Job and Fuller's 1845/Lancer are the obvious choices, both work well.
And the Adnams minicasks if you can find them (Broadside, Bitter and some seasonals) which have the
production dual strain, but not the minikegs like Ghost Ship.


## I beg to differ. I emailed Adnam's to ask them whether Ghost Ship used a different yeast in the keg and
was told that no additional yeast was added, but that the beer was filtered and "there was no yeast in it".
Not so!
I ran off the first 250 ml from a new keg and cultured it up.

Fair play, might be worth noting that on the harvesting thread if you haven't already.
I know Fergus has said that the supermarkets don't like the minicasks as they...get a bit lively...
at ambient temperatures of 20C or more, so they tend to only send them to local ones where they know they
won't sit on the shelf too long.

After that, Brewlab is probably the best choice, particularly the likes of F40 and CC, but these days they're
trying to avoid dealing with retail punters although they do show up at Brewcon, I don't know if they're
still selling a few strains via Hop & Grape - looks like it.
They're generally much more interesting than the US homebrew yeasts, but they come as slopes so you need to
grow them up.

As for Wyeast and White Labs, they're OK, but many of their strains were passed around the homebrew community
for several years before they were banked, so some may have had labels mixed up along the way, and they
definitely seem to have lost some character. For instance, it's often claimed that WLP002 and 1968 are from
Fuller's, but they lack the marmalade that is so typical of the "real" Fuller's yeast - whereas apparently
Imperial A09 Pub still has it, and is meant to be one of the better homebrew yeasts for this style. Or if you
really want "orange" then maybe Voss (either liquid or the Lallemand/MJ/CML dry version) fermented warm but
not too warm?

But lots of the less well known Wyeast/WL yeasts work well enough - although I have yet to try it, from what
I read then the rare Vault strain WLP038 Manchester may be the best of them - it's a member of the saison
family and slightly phenolic, as so many "real" British strains are like eg Harvey's.
And if we're talking weird rare Vault strains, then WLP050 Tennessee Whiskey (yes really) is fun - a rare
POF - distilling strain with some nice floral aromas which can go up to 15% ABV.
1469 is one of the best of the mainstream strains, also a lot of people like WLP028 Edinburgh as a fairly
clean house yeast for British styles.

One strain that is British despite the name is WLP041 Pacific which probably represents an isolate of the
Gale's yeast taken to the US and just makes really drinkable pints, well worth a go.
But otherwise - all those in the WLP02x and WLP03x ranges are worth a try to see how you get on with them,
even if it's a question of grabbing them as they come out of the Vault.

Fans of 1318 may want to note that the new Lallemand Verdant is a dry version of a derivative of 1318 and
people seem pretty happy with it in bitter - it is notorious for a certain vanilla flavour with some people,
which may be an interaction with too much maize or wheat in the grist boosting levels of ferulic acid.
 

## if I am willing to pay £3.80+ for a pint of cask ale in a pub why an I getting so worked up over the prospect of paying £7-£8 for a vial of yeast that will make 18 pints (I do 9L batches).

Well quite - and British styles are one where it's worth the premium, whereas it's perhaps less worth it for
US styles where dry US-05 and equivalents do a good enough job compared to the liquid ones in most cases.
Also worth mentioning that repitching will help reduce the ££ per batch, although I wouldn't typically go more
than 6-8 repitches.]

Windsor is a classic example of a yeast that drops well but doesn't flocculate well. So it can produce very clear
beer, but if you disturb it at all it "puffs up" easily, so isn't a great choice eg if keg-conditioning.
OTOH, a classic combination is to start fermentation with Windsor for the flavour, then add a bit of Nottingham
at high krausen to help drop out the Windsor (you only need one strain that flocculates well to drop out all of
them).
 

## What's the Lallemand London dry like?

Genetically it's a relative of the S-33/Muntons Ordinary/Windsor group that probably derived from the old EDME
homebrew yeast, but it's a bit blander - not sure what's the point. 


## I’ve had the best results with MJ M42 New world strong. Really brought the hoppy flavours out in a galaxy pale I did recently.

Classic example of MJ repackaging - M42 is almost certainly repackaged Nottingham.
Also worth mentioning that Munton's Gold and the Wilko beer yeast look very similar to Notty - and at £2/11g,
the Gervin English Ale yeast at Wilko is probably the cheapest version.

But if you want cheap, then the Allinson's bread yeast seems to work OK in beer - don't listen to US brewers
who obviously have different bread yeasts.

One other thought - as mentioned above, a lot of traditional British yeasts are in fact a bit phenolic,
so T-58 works fairly well, you might even consider something like Belle Saison either on its own or in
a blend, fermented on the cool side.
