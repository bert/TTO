|   3 | 03-05-2023 | 304 |       | Tasting by Clibit: Tonight's treat is a bottle of Belgian Strong Ale, hand delivered from the Low Countries by TTO. I'm not an expert with this style by any stretch, I rarely drink big beers of any kind. But tjis is a treat, I'm very much enjoying it as a nice change. It does remind me a bit of the Westmalle Tripel I had last year. I detect no faults with it. There's a big sweet pilsner malt base, the alcohol is a big influence, in a good way - there's no fusels - and the yeast is how I like it in a Belgian beer - not extreme phenolics, it makes for a very balanced beer. I really do think you made a great job of this beer Thirsty, I would be chuffed to have brewed this myself. Cheers big man. |
