|   3 | 02-03-2023 |  64 |       | Tasting by Clibit: Having done a bit of gardening I felt I deserved a glass of beer. This is a beer delivered to my door from abroad by TTO, and it's a Godiva Golden Ale. It's a really nice one. It's well hopped which really suits me. Bitterness is spot on. Extremely refreshing. My first thought was apricot and citrus, like Tangerine. With a light spice. The official Godiva description says white fruit (grapes), citrus and herbal/floral. I get the floral. I don't have the recipe but I don't spot much if any crystal, maybe a little pale crystal? I suspect 1044 ish? 35 IBU? Yeast? Verdant? I could be miles out!! I'd be very happy if I'd made this. A lovely beer for the sunshine. I poured a bit of yeast, it was crystal clear prior til that last bit. |
