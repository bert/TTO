# Fermentation problems @ July 8th, 2021.

11 days ago I bottled an apple cider (OG 1.040 to FG 0.994, pH from 3.59
to 3.86) which bubbled for almost 3 weeks with MJ's Cider yeast.

Last Sunday I put pear juice in the fermenter with an OG of 1.044 and
pH of 3.97 with the remains of said MJ's Cider yeast package, which
bubbled for a mere 30 hours and then went dormant/stalled/lazy yesterday
morning.

Gave it some time yesterday to recover from the nocturnals and then
sprinkled some (Lallemand Servomyces, basically for beer, it contains
a.o. dead yeast cells and Zinc) yeast nutrient last night (0.2 g/L) and
raised temp a whole degree to 20.5 C ...sofar to no avail.

Methinks the pear juice I used contains more starch than the apple juice
of the former fermentation.

I read somewhere that pH below 3.2 might cause problems for cider yeast
to thrive in, the pear juice is well above that, so the acidity may not
be a primary concern.

You guys have any thoughts ?

Like adding enzymes to break up and convert starch into something the
yeast can chew on ?

Maybe give a rouse or two ?
