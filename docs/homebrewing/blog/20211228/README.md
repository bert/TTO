# Brew day @ December 28th, 2021.

I had a brew day in two halves today.
I started preparing for mash at 11:00 hours this morning and added all
the required salts, gypsum and lactic acid as per the recipe, no goof
ups this time.
Then mash in at the correct temperature of 72 C and maintaining
temperatures on the lowish side of 65 C for an hour and then mash out
for 10 minutes at 75 C. OK, sofar so good, mash went well.
Then the sparge done in two batches and ended up with 0.75 L  too much
wort at 0.005 below target gravity.
So have to tweak the absorption parameter in future recipes.
Brewing software gave me 43 minutes extra time to boil off to get on the
desired gravity.
Luckily this recipe only had aroma hops so may turn out a little bit
darker then foreseen.
Then a power outage at 13:15 hours.
After 45 minutes back on the task at hand (brewing) and decided to do
the boil on the gas hob and hopstand anyway, as to get sterile wort.
And then wait and see when to pitch yeast whenever power for the
temperature controlled fridge is back, because it's way below
US-05/Lallemand New England fermentation temperatures in the brew shed.
At 16:00 hours some vans with a digger from the power company arrive,
this one is going to be a bit longer then expected, so I start searching
for headlights from my fishing tackle box, only just half an hour of
daylight left.
SWMBO cooks supper with the headlight, it's getting foggy in the house.
Second half of the brew day I pitch the yeast at 22:00 hours sharp when
the fridge is on the desired temperature.
