# Bottling day @ April 18th, 2021.

Dry hopping at day 7 of fermentation went fine.

It felt a bit awkward to open the lid of the bucket in the confinement
of the brew fridge.

I used a hop sock for the pellet hops, forgot the weights to make it
submerge.

It turned out to be no problem when I opened the fermenter after
draining for bottling.

Readings gave a very low Final Gravity of 1.002, resulting in a Alcohol
by Volume of 6.8 %.

Bottled 13 bottles with dry hopped Simcoe APA and 2 bottles from the
experimental PET bottle fermentation (same FG so also an ABV of 6.8 %)
without the dry hopping.
