# Bottling day @ May 16th, 2021.

This afternoon I bottled my uneven split brew of two weeks ago ... 2
bottles of SMaSH Magnum fermented with Fermentis US-05 harvested slurry,
fermented in a 1.5 L PET bottle.

The other part of the wort gave 14 bottles of a single malt Blonde Ale
with Magnum as kettle and late hops and was dry hopped with Citra and
Centennial, fermented with Fermentis S-04 yeast from a package.
