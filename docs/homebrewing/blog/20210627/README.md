# Bottling day @ June, 27th 2021.

I changed plans and did a lazy apple cider brew for the last 3 weeks:
just pour apple juice in the fermenter and added Mangrove Jack's Cider
yeast.

Bottled 16 33 cl bottles from a 5.6 L fermenting bucket.

The yeast formed a dense cake at the bottom.

Will be a cloudy cider, maybe because the juice was unfiltered.

Got an ABV of 6 % (OG 1.040 to FG 0.994) ... I left the cider in the
bucket for 21 days as it was still bubbling at day 19.

pH went from 5.83 to 3.86.
