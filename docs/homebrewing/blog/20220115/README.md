# Bottling day @ January 15th, 2022.

I bottled the December 2021 split batch today: 7 bottles of Shameless
Magpied Summer Ale, 2 bottles of the Three Hops Blonde v2 and v3 each.

The Shameless Magpied Summer Ale ended at a final gravity of 1.006,
giving an ABV of 5.1 %.

The Thee Hops Blonde v2 ended at 1.005 (5.4 %) and the v3 ended at 1.008
(5.0 %).

On to beer tasting day in a couple of weeks.
