# Bottling day @ July 22nd, 2022

Just bottled my Belgian Golden Strong Ale now temperatures are still low.

Targets was an ABV of 8.7 % which became 7.9 % because my OG was 10 points
lower than expected because my grain absorption, mash efficiency and
evaporation were lower, and so I ended up with too much wort.

Still tuning in grain absorption and mash efficiency because of the new
grain mill by adjusting the mill gap.

The split off batches went a bit lower on final gravity and reached an
ABV of 8.0 %.
