# Brew day @ November 6th, 2022.

I'm brewing my first ever Best Bitter today after a recipe from the Five
Points brewery and The Malt Miller.

Hops were already in stock, so the only thing left to decide was yeast.

Ordered and received the malts from The Malt Miller pre-crushed some time
ago.

First pondering over whether a liquid yeast or dry yeast, and than what
strain to use.

Eventually opted for Lallemand London Ale dry yeast.
