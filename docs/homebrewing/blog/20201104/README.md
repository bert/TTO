# Bottling day @ November 4th, 2020.

Bottled the SMaSH Fuggle British Golden ale this evening.

Yield was 4 Litres, a litre less than expected due to sediment I did not
want in the bottles.

ABV was 4.5 % (+0.2 %) due to higher attenuation, IBU was spot on the
mark.

Now into conditioning and the long wait for tasting in 2 or 3 weeks .
