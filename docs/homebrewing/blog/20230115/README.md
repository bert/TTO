# Brew day @ January 15th, 2023.

I'm having a Face-Paw moment:

Yesterday I crushed the malt for today's brew with the same mill gap setting as in the previous brews.

Forgot that I had an other malt in this brew, with considerable smaller kernel diameter.

During dough in I noticed that many kernels were not broken ... resulting in a mash efficiency of 52 %.

Now adding sugar to get a decent ABV.

Scores on the door:
