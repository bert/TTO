# Brew day @ April 4th, 2021.

I brewed a Single Malt and Single Hop American Pale Ale with Thomas
Fawcett Maris Otter Pale Ale malt, Simcoe pellet hops and Fermentis
US-05 yeast.

I had too much wort after the boil and after filling  the fermenter the
trub from the kettle went into a sanitized PET bottle for experimenting
(no dry hopping).

In the PET bottle I added harvested yeast from a previous batch, to see
how far I can go with yeast ranching.
