# Beer tasting day @ December 16th, 2022.

Had one from batch #6 ... 740 days after brew day, 8 bottles left to go
... still no card board flavours ... good carbonation, nice foam head,
clinging to the glass ... 't was a Sinterklaas Special brew kit ...
Sinterklaas is the Dutch Santa Claus 3 weeks early ... still strong on
cinnamon and other stuff making it taste like Christmas ... not boozy,
just a good blonde ale with cinnamon flavour.
