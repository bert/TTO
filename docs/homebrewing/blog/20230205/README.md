# Brew day @ February 5th, 20223

I'm brewing my entry for the [11th Homebrewing UK competition](https://www.homebrewinguk.com/post/11th-hbuk-competition-boddingtons-bitter-closing-date-31st-march-2023-12509547).

The target is Boddingtons as brewed 40 to 50 years ago in the
Strangeways Brewery before it went downhill.
Appearance was pale straw in colour with a good, lasting, creamy, white
head.
Aroma was straw/hay.
Taste was bitter, dry and very moreish.
A low OG of 1.035 and high attenuation gave the dryness yet the beer was
not thin!

Well, after some forum discussiona regarding colour being 6...8 or 14
EBC, some last changes in the malt bill: Amber Malt (50 EBC) out and
Crystal malt (150 EBC) in ... and sorting what gap to set the malt mill
... finaly got brewing.

And then the bodging started ... pre-boil SG too high ... so I added
more sparge water.

Too less boil off ... or so it seemed ... hydrometer got bodged ... gave
0.995 in pure water ... so gave up fiddling and let the wort cool down
for the yeast pitch tomorrow morning.

To be fermented with Lallemand Windsor dry yeast.
